# BG3 Entity Metadata Indexing Project (Module: M-01)

## Overview
This repository is a technical environment dedicated to testing structured data (JSON-LD) and metadata categorization for specific character entities within the *Baldur's Gate 3* ecosystem. 

The primary focus of this module is the evaluation of community-driven asset scoring and automated indexing of external visual resources.

## Technical Objectives
- **Schema.org Integration:** Testing `ImageGallery` and `FAQPage` structured data for improved search engine visibility.
- **Metadata Mapping:** Categorizing external visual assets based on community-driven quality scores.
- **Static Site Performance:** Evaluating Tailwind CSS JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation on GitHub Pages environments.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The primary rendering engine for metadata visualization.
- `sitemap.xml`: Automated crawl map for search engine bots.
- `.nojekyll`: Bypass Jekyll processing for raw HTML/CSS delivery.

## Curation Methodology
Assets are indexed based on a weighted scoring algorithm derived from external community databases. This ensures that only high-fidelity visual renders are categorized within the tracking module.
